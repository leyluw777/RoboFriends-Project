# RoboFriends-Project
***Demo version of website:*** https://leyluw777.github.io/RoboFriends-Project/

## Description
This is SP project which generates cards according to the input. The project was fully written on React and the main aim of its creating is demonstration of React funcitonality.


## Technologies 
What I used in project:
* React
* CSS
* Tachyons


## Features
* The page is fully responsive. For responsiveness Tachyons CSS framework was used.
* The data was taken from fake REST API (JSON placeholder) and used by using props in all cards. 
* You can see the input, and while you are typing, the cards is filtered according to the searchbox.
* _Features that are not visible:_
  - Loading screen. If the cards are loading too long, there is simple loading screen which says about load.
  - Boundary error. The new feature of React was also used, so if there is any error according to the cards, then error message will appears instead of cards.
